ERROR DESCRIPTION:
The compression filter code is expecting a Content-Type header.
If a response does not have one because it has no response data
a NullPointerException will occur and a 500 status code is
returned instead of the original status code.

In the logs, the following FFDC entry will be generated:

[5/4/12 19:34:56:576 GMT] FFDC
Exception:java.lang.NullPointerException
SourceId:com.ibm.ws.proxy.filter.http.HttpFilterChain.doResponse
FilterChain ProbeId:1

java.lang.NullPointerException

doFilter(HttpResponseCompressionFilter.java:113)

USERS AFFECTED:
All users of IBM WebSphere Application Server V7.0

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
If the Proxy Server is configured for compression, a response with no Content-Type header
will cause an NullPointerException and a 500 response to be sent back.

The Proxy compression filter code expects inspects the Content-Type header on the
response without checking if it exists. This causes an NPE and an FFDC.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION:
The Proxy Compression Filter will be changed to handle no
Content-Type response header.

This fix is currently targeted for inclusion in Service
Level (Fix Pack) 7.0.0.25 of WebSphere Application Server V7.0
(using APAR PM66048).
